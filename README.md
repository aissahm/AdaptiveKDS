## AdaptiveKDS

From the paper "Efficient Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Data: A Client Selection and Adaptive Knowledge Distillation Approach"

AdaptiveKDS integrates client selection and knowledge distillation to mitigate communication challenges existing in Federated Learning. By strategically selecting a subset of clients in each training round, AdaptiveKDS accelerates the convergence speed of the shared, global model. The adaptive local knowledge distillation mechanism customizes the knowledge
transfer process to each clientâ€™s local data. This approach effectively tackles the challenge posed by heterogeneous local data distributions.
